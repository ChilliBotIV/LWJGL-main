# LWJGL
 Game should be fairly straight forward to run. I'm still unsure what it means to compile it, but it's probably compiled.
 no keyboard input needed other than esc to close the program.
 mouse/cursor controls a square that you have to move around and avoid the moving square that gets faster every 15 seconds.
 Program closes once you die and should output how long you survived in seconds in the terminal.
